# americancommunitysurvey
This is a collection of sample codes and workflows of American Community Survey PUMS data manipulation. All data used in this respository are available to the public.
Inspired by ad-hoc questions, I decided to create this repository, hoping to facilitate researchers who are interested in using the ACS data.
